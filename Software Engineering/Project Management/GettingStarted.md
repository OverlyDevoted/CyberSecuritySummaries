# Getting Started

To start working on a web project there's a few things you have to plan ahead for.

1. First you have to determine your tech stack
2. Secondly, you have to list out all of the functional requirements for your application
3. Create design mockups according to specified features
4. Break down features into tasks that have:
   - User story (why the feature is needed)
   - Acceptance criteria
5. Then you have to establish development workflow. This includes:
   - How the tasks are being done (i.e. feature is developed, tests written and then pushed)
   - Do PRs after merges get immediately deployed or are they being worked on as minor/major version of an app that then gets deployed after all features are done for the version?
6. Setup up CI/CD processes. This ensures stability and higher quality standards.
