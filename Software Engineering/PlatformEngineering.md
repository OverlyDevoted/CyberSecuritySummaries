# Platform engineering

*Platform engineering is a practice where the main focus is the DevEx. The main focus is making the development process more efficient, secure and less prone to human errors.*

Some key aspects that platform engineering includes is:

- Infrastructure as code (IaC): Code is used for automating provisioning and managing infrastructure components, such as servers, networks or storage. This results in more consistent, repeatable and stable deployments.

- Containerization and orchestration. Use of docker for defining application environments and dependencies and using orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications

- Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD). Changes to production code are automatically tested and deployed for users to use, which allows faster delivery of new content or features.

- Monitoring and logging. Building systems for real-time logging and monitoring and let's to diagnose the state of the service and predict catastrophes 

- DevEx - Developer Experience. Of course all the previous points contribute to easing the life of developer, but also things such as documentation, tools, support, development process streamlining can help to experience less friction during development.

- Scalability and availability - it's important to design a platform that can properly react to increased activity.

- Cloud services - less on premise, more over the cloud. It's not a must, nor not the best solution in most cases
