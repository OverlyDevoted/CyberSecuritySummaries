# Docker

Is used to package your applications/services into units called containers. Let's say you needed to deploy SpringBoot application, so you would create a container with the application and all dependencies needed to run that application, so for SpringBoot Java Runtime.

Containers are created using images. Those images are template that describe what is needed to run an application.

Images and containers are similar to class-object relationship in OOP languages. Image is like a class, it holds a schematic on what elements a class-instance must contain. Container is an object created from a class. So every time an image is run, an identical container is created.
