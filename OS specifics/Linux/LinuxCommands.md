# Linux commands

## Tips 

You can concatenate multiple commands into one call by using `&` symbol

## `sleep <time>`

With sleep you can make the command line sleep for a certain amount of time before executing any command. 

## `ping`

With ping you can ping a server and also cause time delays for the executing server. For example this could be useful in Blind command injection attacks as you could make server processing the request make longer to respond because it is pinging itself or some other IP.
