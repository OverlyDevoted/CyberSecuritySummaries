# Triggers

Triggers are a special type of stored procedures that get automatically called in response to specific events that occur within the database:

- Data modification (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on specific table or view
- Data definition events (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- Logon events (CONNECT, DISCONNECT)
