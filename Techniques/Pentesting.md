# Pentesting

## General methods

| Engagement | Description |
| - | - |
| Black-box | Low level to no target knowledge. So reconnaissance must be performed to learn about the target. Sometimes in profession only company name is given, it's called external penetration. Internal pentest where tester has to bypass controls to gain initial access to the network or can connect to the internal network but has no info about internal network. Simulates actual attacks, but is not as comprehensive as other assessment types and could leave misconfigurations and vulnerabilities open. |
| Grey-box | Tester is given, for example, a list of in-scope IPs addresses/ranges in advance, low-level credentials to web app or active directory. Or some application/network diagrams. Less time of reconnaissance, more time pentesting different vulnerabilities |
| White-box | Given complete access. In web app test, may be given full admin rights, access to source, build diagrams, etc. The purpose for web apps is to look for logic vulnerabilities and other difficult-to-discover flaws. For network is to look for misconfigurations. HIghly comprehensive. |
