## Broken Authentication/Access Control

Broken Authentication and Broken access control are most common and dangerous vulnerabilities for web apps

**Broken authentication** - vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass authentication functions. For example
1. Logging in without having valid credentials
2. Or allow a normal user to become an administrator

**Broken Access** - Refers to attacks that give an attacker access to pages and features they should not have. E.g. Normal user opening admin panel.
