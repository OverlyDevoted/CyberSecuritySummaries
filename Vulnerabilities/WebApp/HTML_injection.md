# HTML Injections

Major aspect of front end security is validating and sanitizing accepted user input. Which often is done in the back-end, but sometimes it never reaches it and the data is used for front-end only, that's why it's still important to sanitize input.

So HTML Injections occurs when unfiltered user supplied data is rendered on the webpage. Sometimes a user could get control of making his input displayed in some way.

We could **inject HTML** as external login forms to get their login data from malicious *server. 

**Web defacing** is changing the appearance of a website, which may cause reputation loss for a server.
