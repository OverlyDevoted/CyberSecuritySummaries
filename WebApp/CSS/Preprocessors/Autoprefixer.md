# Browser specific CSS properties

CSS properties with prefixes like -moz, -webkit, -ms, and others are vendor prefixes. These prefixes are used to apply experimental or browser-specific features that may not be part of the official CSS specification yet or might be implemented differently across browsers during the development phase.

For example, the -moz prefix is associated with Mozilla Firefox, -webkit with WebKit-based browsers (such as Safari and Chrome), and -ms with Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. These prefixes are used to target specific browser engines and ensure that a particular style or feature works as intended in that browser.

Here's an example of how a CSS rule with a vendor prefix might look:

css

div {
  -moz-border-radius: 10px;
  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

In this example, the border-radius property is used to round the corners of a <div>. However, since older versions of Firefox and WebKit-based browsers might not support the standard border-radius property without the prefix, the vendor-prefixed versions are included to ensure compatibility.

It's important to note that vendor prefixes were mainly used during the development phase, and the goal is for developers to transition to using the standard, non-prefixed properties as browser support for those properties becomes widespread. Modern browsers usually support standard CSS properties without the need for prefixes, but it's always a good practice to check for browser compatibility and use prefixes when necessary for older versions.

## Autoprefixing browser specific properties 

One popular tool for this purpose is Autoprefixer. Autoprefixer works with regular CSS, and you can integrate it into your build process or use it as a standalone tool.

## Autoprefixer with SCSS:

### Install Autoprefixer:
You can install Autoprefixer using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:

    bash

`npm install autoprefixer --save-dev`

## Integrate Autoprefixer in Your Build Process:
If you are using a build tool like Gulp, Grunt, or Webpack, you can integrate Autoprefixer into your workflow. For example, if you are using Gulp, you can use the gulp-autoprefixer plugin.

## Standalone Autoprefixer
If you prefer using Autoprefixer as a standalone tool, you can install it globally:

`npm install -g autoprefixer`

Then, you can use it from the command line:

`autoprefixer input.css -o output.css`

Replace input.css and output.css with your actual file names.

Remember to check the documentation for the specific tools or plugins you are using for any additional configuration options. Autoprefixer uses the Can I Use database to determine which prefixes are necessary based on the browsers you want to support.
