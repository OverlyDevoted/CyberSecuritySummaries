It's easy to use `div`s and `span`s for everything, but it's nicer to have tags that are distinguishable just by name.

There are many other elements like
| Element | Description |
| - | - |
| `<article>` | Defines independent, self-contained content |
| `<aside>` | Usually for content that is on the side of the main page content |
| `<details>` | Used for specifying additional details about something. Usually this element can be revealed and hidden by the user. Used in pair with `<summary>` | 
| `<figure>` | is for creating different types of figures, like images, tables etc.  Used in pair with `<figcaption>`|
| `<time>` | For specifying exact time-stamp for a text described inside textContent of an `time` element |
| `<mark>` | Marks important text |
