Used to catch very simple bug, or can be used to configure formatting so that the code looks like one person wrote it. Depends on a project, but it may be a hassle to set it up to make it force the code to be as uniform as possible. If you are coding for someone else, like selling code, you would probably would want to format the code as uniform as possible. In other cases, you can just use it for simple rules, for formatting use something like prettier.
