Forms usually are a part of software where an user can enter some data. Forms in react have a couple of different gatchas and there are different ways to solve them. Most common features you will encounter are:

- Input fields
  - Input field validation based on various patterns
- Select fields
  - Their options might come from a backend
- State dependant fields
  - Some fields might only appear only when a certain option is selected
  - Some fields might be required only when a certain option is selected
- Errors
  - Every field has different errors
  - One field has multiple different errors (empty field, field too long, etc.)
- Submits
  - Might include backend calls
