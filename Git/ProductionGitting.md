## Branches

We always checkout from main/feature and make changes to it

Branches and PRs should be prefixed with a task descriptor. Whether it's bugfix, feature, hotfixes, documentation.

Usually some kind of project management is used. So if tasks have codes, they should be referenced and short description to the branch should be provided
