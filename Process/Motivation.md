# The process of achieving Mastery
This document will contain just general knowledge about programming, the process of learning, how to approach problems and etc.

## Programming
You do not have to know every single programming language, but what you should do is to develop a deep understanding of software engineering.

R. D. Tennent has defined these principles that define all programming languages:
1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

How would you solve this math problem?:
20 * _____ + _____ = 65535

After solving the problem, ask yourself: how many different ways is there of solving this problem and why did you choose the way chose?

```
I solved the problem by realizing that you can multiply the 20 by any number that would not make the sum bigger than the answer and then just adding the remainder of answer - multiplication operation. Before choosing this way I was a little bit confused about how would I choose the correct numbers, but then I realized that I can choose a lot of different number combinations and made that my answer to the math problem.
```

But the problem has no limitations, we could've added more arithmetic operations, add more digits, replace the given, and that is - `Thinking outside the box`

So why did we not think to do that?

```
I think because I saw the two blanks and automatically though that I had to insert two numbers, when in reality I could've inserted anything I wanted that would've helped me to solve the problem. The problem with my current way of think is not including more possibilities, not thinking of more potential ways of solving problems. I understand that I can test many different scenarios to see if I get a desired outcome, but I rarely generate different scenarios that could lead me to getting desired results.  
```

Thinking outside the box let's us cross the imaginary boundaries thus letting us access possibilities and options that were not recognized by us before.

Occam's Razor is a central principle of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:
`The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: the simplest explanation is always the most probable`

## Talent
How many people can naturally fly an airplane?
Without any prior knowledge I think almost nobody can fly an airplane. But a person who has studied controlling airplanes, physics and such, could make the airplane take off, but still, actually applying the knowledge is crucial too. So constant or persistent confrontation with problems and being in the process of solving them helps us improve and become that TALENTED person we are jealous of. Because as we solve more and more problems our understanding expands and our tool repertoire.

Of course, it's important to consider that learning to play a guitar for someone who has never played a guitar will be considerably more difficult than for someone who knows how to play other string instruments. Of course, it's also worth comparing not only a guitarist versus a person who does not know music, we can compare a person without prior music knowledge to a any musician. We know that a musician will have some knowledge of how music works and will be learning entirely different skills than a person who has never worked with music in their life. So if doing comparing it's important to gather as many variables as possible, and stay away from premature assumptions.

We can even draw a parenting lessons from this, that it's important to expose kids to problems and parts of life that they are most likely to encounter.'

## Goals

It's important to have a goal in mind. A person without a goal roams around aimlessly, from one thing to another. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. But having a goal can help you stay on track and tell you where and when to move forward with things, what to focus on. 

Consider these two scenarios:
```You are standing still and you are instructed to move across the room, and you start moving. After a while, instructor puts a chair in your way. What will you do? - You may sit on the chair, or you may continue moving.
```
```
Your instructor instructs you to move to the other corner, and the instructor puts down the chair in your way again. What will you do?
You will pass the chair to reach your goal
```

These scenarios illustrate how important it is to have a goal as the difference between them is having and not having one.
So with a goal we will overcome obstacles in our way to reach our goals. With this being said, what is your goal by doing your front-end course and doing this cyber-security training?
