# Work environments | Lab environment for pentesting

It's often good to setup a VM for making projects, testing different vulnerabilities, having access to pentesting tools.

Good starting place is downloading either ParrotSO, Kali, or any Linux Distro and setup it up with any tool you want.

My first:
[ParrotOS HTB edition download](https://parrotlinux.org/download/)
[ParrotOS installation on VirtualBox](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/virtualization/install-parrot-on-virtualbox)
### ISO

The ISO file is essentially just a CD-ROM that can be mounted within our hypervisor of choice to build the VM by installing the operating system ourselves. An ISO gives us more room for customization, e.g., keyboard layout, locale, desktop environment switch, custom partitioning, etc., and therefore a more granular approach when setting up our attack VM.

### OVA

The OVA file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an OVF XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a VMDK, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An OVA is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.

## Organization
Folder structure for attack machine to save: scoping information, enumeration data, evidence of exploitation attempts, sensitive data such as credentials and all other data gathered during recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation.

```
Projects/
└── Acme Company
    ├── EPT
    │   ├── evidence
    │   │   ├── credentials
    │   │   ├── data
    │   │   └── screenshots
    │   ├── logs
    │   ├── scans
    │   ├── scope

```
This folder structure is for **Acme Company** pentest as we can see there are documentation folders for
**Internal Penetration Test (IPT)** and **External Penetration Test (EPT)**. 
These folders contain:
- Scan data
- Relevant tools
- Logging output
- Scoping information (e.g. Lists of IP/networks possibly needed for other tools)
- Evidence folder (e.g. for credentials, or any other relevant data)
