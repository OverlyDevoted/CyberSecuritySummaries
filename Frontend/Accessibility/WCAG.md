They are numerous different limiting factors that make it difficult to use computers and specifically web apps for people. People use assistive technologies to help them to alleviate those difficulties. But as developers we can design systems in a way that does not hinder but assists but people with difficulties.

Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) - provides a set of measurable criteria that help determine how accessible a web app is. It is a great starting point for making a web app more accessible

Accessible rich internet applications (ARIA) - it's a standard specifications that contains rules for different roles, states and properties that are then used in HTML to supply information needed to support accessibility tools

Normative vs Non-normative documents

Normative references are typically references to established standards documents, that have been published by recognized groups that may be of close relation to W3C. These are used for measuring compliance

Non-normative references are informal references that are used as more as learning tools, for familiarization

Screen readers - is a type of assistive technology (AT) that helps to interact with a computer. It can read what is seen on the screen. It works on text-to-speech principle that it converts text and elements on the screen to speech or Braille output, so that people that use these ATs can consume content provided.

Historically iPhones have good screen readers called VoiceOver, Macs also have ones built-in. For windows there's Narrator, but also third-party tools exists. NVDA, JAWS, etc.
