It's easy to use `div`s and `span`s for everything, but it's nicer to have tags that are distinguishable just by name. Div is usually used as a styling wrapper.

## Block elements, containers

There are many other elements like

| Element     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Text

`span` is similarly used as a `div` mainly for styling purposes. For example: If you had a product description that included a price. We generally would wrap such element in a paragraph. Then if we wanted to style it in any way we would wrap it in a span.
