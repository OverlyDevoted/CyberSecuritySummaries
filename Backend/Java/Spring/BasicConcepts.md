What is Spring, Spring Framework and Spring Boot

Spring is the brand

Spring Framework is a base framework that abstracts a lot of layers for creating a backend microservice application, it handles HTTP protocol implementation.

Spring boot is a collection of different Spring based applications that provide many different additions, like MVC, Kafka integration, Logger integrations and many many other things.

Core features:
IOC - inversion of control container. Is a tool that helps to streamline the configuration and management of Java objects.

IOC uses dependency injection or dependency injection patterns to provide objects reference during run time.

AOP - aspect oriented programming - increases modularity by separating cross cutting concerns to functions that span across the application. It does so by adding behavior to existing code (an advice) without modifying the code, instead separately specifying which code is modified via a "pointcut" specification, such as "log all function calls when the function's name begins with 'set'". This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without cluttering the code of core functions. 

DAF - data access framework
