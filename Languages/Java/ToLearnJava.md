## Core Java Fundamentals

### Java Syntax & Basics

  Variables, Data Types, Operators
  Control Flow Statements (if-else, switch, loops)
  Methods & Functions

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

  Classes & Objects
  Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
  Interfaces & Abstract Classes

### Exception Handling

  try-catch-finally, throw, throws
  Custom Exceptions

### Collections Framework

  List (ArrayList, LinkedList)
  Set (HashSet, TreeSet)
  Map (HashMap, TreeMap)
  Queue (PriorityQueue, Deque)

✔ Generics

    Type Parameters <T>
    Bounded and Unbounded Wildcards

✔ Java I/O

    File Handling (File, FileReader, FileWriter)
    Buffered Streams
    Serialization

2. Java Advanced Topics

✔ Multithreading & Concurrency

    Threads (Thread class, Runnable interface)
    Executors & Thread Pool
    Synchronization & Locks
    CompletableFuture

✔ Functional Programming & Streams API

    Lambda Expressions
    Streams (map, filter, reduce)
    Method References

✔ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

    Connecting Java to Databases
    CRUD Operations using JDBC
    Connection Pooling (HikariCP)

✔ Annotations & Reflection API

    Custom Annotations
    Java Reflection for Class Inspection

✔ Maven or Gradle

    Dependency Management
    Build Lifecycle & Plugins

✔ Unit Testing

    JUnit & Mockito
    Writing & Running Test Cases

3. Web & Backend Concepts (Before Spring)

✔ RESTful API Basics

    HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    JSON & XML Handling (Jackson)

✔ Servlets & JSP (Optional but good for understanding Java Web Basics)

✔ Design Patterns (Common in Spring)

    Singleton
    Factory
    Dependency Injection (DI)
    MVC (Model-View-Controller)

✔ Basic Security Concepts

    Hashing & Encryption (BCrypt)
    Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth2)

4. Spring Prerequisites

✔ Understanding Dependency Injection (DI)
✔ Understanding Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
✔ Basic Understanding of Hibernate/JPA
✔ Understanding MVC Architecture
