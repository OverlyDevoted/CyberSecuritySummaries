# Object-oriented programming

1. Encapsulation

The process of building related data and methods into a type. It facilitates the ease of data-structure and related processing operations

2. Inheritance

Is creating base class and derived class relationships. This makes derived class _inherit_ the members, properties and methods of the base class

3. Polymorphism

Is referencing objects of different types by their common interfaces. While objects maintain their unique functionality we can use the commonalities to bring them together when needed.
